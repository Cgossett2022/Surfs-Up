# Surfs-Up-Analysis

## Overview
For this project, I am considering opening a Surf and Shake Shop in Hawaii. My goal is to provide surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists. In order to get my business up and running, I need funding from investors. Since the largest risk to my business is the weather, I had to perform an analysis on the weather patterns, using SQLite and SQLAlchemy. Once I have some results, I believe potential investors will consider backing my business once they understand the weather risks. 


## Results
I started my analysis by looking at June's temperatures.
