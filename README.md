# SurfsUp-Analysis

## Overview
For this project, I am considering opening a Surf and Shake Shop in Hawaii. My goal is to provide surfboards and ice cream to locals and tourists. In order to get my business up and running, I need funding from investors. Since the largest risk to my business is the weather, I had to use SQLite and SQLAlchemy to perform an analysis, which tracks weather patterns in the region. Once I have my results, I believe potential investors will consider backing my business once they understand the risk. 


## Results
I started my analysis by looking at June's temperatures.
