# Surfs-Up-Analysis


## Overview
For this project, I considered opening a Surf and Shake Shop in Hawaii, which will provide surfboards and ice cream to locals. In order to get my business up and running, I needed funding from investors. W. Avy is an investor who is interested in my business, but he is concerned about the weather risks that could threaten my success. In order to move forward with W. Avy, I used SQLite and SQLAlchemy to perform an analysis on the weather temperatures for June and December. 


## Results

- I started my analysis by looking at June's temperatures. Based on my results, June has an average temperature of 74.94F, a minimum of 64F, and a maximum of 85F.

- Next, I analyzed December's temperatures. Based on my results, December has an average temperature of 71.04F, a minimum of 56F, and a maximum of 83F.

- After comparing temperatures, I noticed that June had a standard deviation of 3.26, while December had 3.75. 


## Summary

- After analyzing my results, I concluded that December would pose a higher risk to my business than June, due to its higher varation in temperatures. 
With this in mind, I may need to consider operating seasonally so I could avoid cold temperatures.

- In addition to temperature, I looked at precipation for both months.
