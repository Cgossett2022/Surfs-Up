# Surfs-Up-Analysis

## Overview
For this project, I considered opening a Surf and Shake Shop in Hawaii, which will provide surfboards and ice cream to locals. In order to get my business up and running, I needed funding from investors. W. Avy is an investor who is interested in my business, but he is concerned about the weather risks that could threaten my success. In order to move forward with W. Avy, I used SQLite and SQLAlchemy to perform an analysis on the weather temperatures for June and December. 

## Results

I started my analysis by looking at June's temperatures.
