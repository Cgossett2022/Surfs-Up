# Surfs-Up-Analysis


## Overview
For this project, I considered opening a Surf n' Shake Shop in Oahu, Hawaii, which will provide surfboards and ice cream to locals. In order to get my business up and running, I reached out to W. Avy, who is an investor interested in my business. W. Avy liked my idea, but his only concern was the weather risks, which could threaten my success. In order to move forward with W. Avy, I used SQLite and Pandas to perform an analysis on the weather temperatures for June and December. 


## Results

- I started my analysis by looking at June's temperatures. Based on my results, June has a mean temperature of 74.94F, a minimum of 64F, and a maximum of 85F.

- Next, I analyzed December's temperatures. Based on my results, December has a mean temperature of 71.04F, a minimum of 56F, and a maximum of 83F.

- After comparing temperatures, I noticed that June had a standard deviation of 3.26, while December had 3.75. 


## Summary

### Temperature Summary

Overall, the temperature in Oahu is relatively constant throughout the year, often hovering around the low 70's. These would be ideal conditions for my business and I don't believe temperatures will pose a threat.

### Precipitation Results

In addition to temperature, I decided to look at precipitation for both months.

- June reflected a mean rainfall of 14% and a standard deviation of 34%.

### End Summary

Based on both the temperature and precipitation in Oahu, the weather is consistent throughout the year, with temperatures in the 70's and minimal rainfall. Even though December's weather patterns have more variation, the results show that Surf n' Shake would be sucessful in Oahu.
